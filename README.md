# Smoke_Detection

Collection of training data is performed with the help of IOT devices since the goal is to develop a AI based smoke detector device.
Many different environments and fire sources have to be sampled to ensure a good dataset for training. A short list of different scenarios which are captured:

Normal indoor
Normal outdoor
Indoor wood fire, firefighter training area
Indoor gas fire, firefighter training area
Outdoor wood, coal, and gas grill
Outdoor high humidity
etc.
The dataset is nearly 60.000 readings long. The sample rate is 1Hz for all sensors. To keep track of the data, a UTC timestamp is added to every sensor reading.
